    <p1>A random question will pop up at the top right of the screen as well as 3 different
    answer options. You have to choose the best suited state that you think answers the
    question the most. If you get it right you will earn a point, lets see how many you
    can get in a row! If you get a question wrong you will be taken back to the start
    and your streak will be lost. Your score will show in the leaderboard in the home page. </p1>
